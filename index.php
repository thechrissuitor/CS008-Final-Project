        Dogs today are beaten, chained, and starved. They face a lot of horrendous amounts of
        trauma, and families refuse to take them because they are left mentally and physically scarred.
        The purpose of Save Our Sweeties(SOS) is to inspire families and individuals looking
        for dogs to rescue them. Take in the sad, broken dog and your reward will be much greater than
        simply adopting a clean puppy from the nearest pet store. Your love, care, and affection
        can save lives. To a recovering rescued dog, your love will be the most important thing in their
        life, and in return, the dog shall love you unconditionally.
