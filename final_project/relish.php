        Some people believe in karma – a force where your good-intentioned actions 
        will lead to good fortune and a good life, and ill-intentioned actions lead 
        to long-term suffering and poor lives in the future on actor. Karma is a 
        force of justice – rewarding the well-meaning agents in the world with a
        better time here, like a promotion to the good employees.</p>
    <aside class="blockQuote">"It is up to all of us to... give these dogs that which they so deserve."</aside>
    <p>Whether or not
        karma exists, it is painfully clear that these dogs need something good 
        to come into their life, because it is our duty to try and make the world
        as fair as possible, and it would be neither fair nor just if these dogs 
        had to continue living in such an unreasonable fashion as they have been.
        After all of that abuse, all that neglect and lack of love, the nights where these
        dogs endured indescribably pain and torment, they deserve a break. It is my great 
        pleasure to say that some of these dogs are given the grace of a now home.

        For example there is the story of Hercules, a black Mastiff mix who was given the love
        he so desired. He was adopted by a family in Colorado Springs, and is “anxiously 
        awaiting all the trail walks, my fenced yard and playing with my new two legged 
        brother!” The only one more excited the Herculus is probably the 9 year old in his
        family. Herculus is not the only dog that is excited to meet his new family.
        Sipsey is a Newfie, and is a new addition to an already robust and dynamic family 
        full of other pets, who are all excited to meet Sipsey and welcome Sipsey to their
        family. Ivan is a Bullmastiff, a gentle giant, and is emphatic about joining his
        new family in California. Diesel is a Great Dane and is so very excited to meet,
        greet and love his new family in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Pumpkin the Saint 
        Bernard is going to Illinois to join his new home, and is ready for a new life.
        Rimbo the Great Dane has suffered for most of his life, but is now getting a new
        chance at happiness through a new family. The great seesaw of life has begin
        tilting towards balance as these dogs are getting a new home. But alas, these
        dogs are just the tip of the iceberg, as far too many more dogs remain at Big
        Dogs Huge Paws, or even worse under the “care” of an abuser.
        These dogs are just looking for the light of life to shine their way, for a 
        chance at a life that is even a bit better than now. A million to one shot at 
        better is a risk worth taking, because for them it ca not get any worse. But 
        unfortunately the ball is not in their court. They are not the players in this 
        world, merely the ball in a game being played. It is up to all of us to move 
        forward and give these dogs that which they so deserve.
