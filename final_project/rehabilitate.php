    The world had been stolen from these dogs. They life up this point had been 
    a long, hard, painful road. They had been neglected, they had been starved,
    they had been chained, and worse. Some had to endure the horrors of dog fights, 
    being forced to fight each other for the exchange of dirty money, of which was
    tainted with the blood of innocence. Some were forced to breed non-stop in 
    puppy mills, where their children were taken from them and sold for a petty 
    profit, just so they could repeat the whole process again, mother and father
    never seeing their children as an unseen stranger took them away to an unvetted
    home, hopefully somewhere better but very likely somewhere worse. Once finally
    reported to the authorities and the dogs are given to Big Dogs Huge Paws, 
    they can finally begin doing what they are there for: bringing these dogs 
    back from, in many cases and situations, the brink of death, back to a world
    in which they can know what it’s like for an owner to truly love them. This 
    is done through positive reinforcement, because Big Dogs Huge Paws believes 
    that the only way to get a dog to love again is to love them right back.

    “Big Dogs Huge Paws supports use of treats, praise, and redirection of 
    unwanted behaviors in order to aid in teaching your giant breed dog to 
    become a good canine citizen.” This commitment to making these dogs better
    through positive reinforcement is what make Big Dogs Huge Paws such a 
    reputable organization. People know that the dogs they are getting are 
    ready to be loved once again, because Big Dogs Huge Paws has worked hard, 
    day and night, in order to restore them to the dog they once were. Some of 
    the conditions that can hold the dogs back are triggers, certain events 
    that bring the dog to a state of post traumatic stress disorder, and can be 
    a huge setback. Most abusers are male, so the dogs also have trouble working
    with men and are more responsive to women. In light of this, Big Dogs Huge 
    Paws uses a healthy diet and exercise in addition to positive reinforcement 
    in order to counter the lack of nutrition and exercise the dogs received 
    while being abused. This helps fight the trauma on all fronts. Unfortunately,
    many dogs were hurt to the point where they are injured beyond what Big Dogs 
    Huge Paws can treat in house, and therefore can require some medical attention.
    This can be more expensive than a regular dog because of the need for further
    medical care due to permanent and/or chronic damage that they sustained before 
    they came to the shelter, but if you can afford the dog then it is well worth 
    any additional costs. These dogs have seen the worst of the world, so when they 
    are given a home that’s relatively so much better than the life they knew, it
    is that much better. It also feel so much better to know that you changed their life.
