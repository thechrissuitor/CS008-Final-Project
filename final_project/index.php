        Dogs today are beaten, chained, and starved. The amount of abuse, between 
        neglectful and abusive owners all the way up through dog fighting rings, 
        is unimaginably immense and wrong. They go through horrendous amounts of 
        trauma and cruelty, and families refuse to take them because they are 
        left physically and mentally scarred, even though a family is the key 
        to getting them better. The purpose of Save Our Sweeties is the inspire
        families looking for dogs to adopt to rescue them. If you’re already
        looking for a dog, then all you need to do is take in a single dog to
        change the course of its life. As a result, if you take in a sad, broken
        dog, then your reward will be much greater than simply adopting a clean
        puppy from the nearest pet store. These dogs have had everything taken 
        from them, and your love, care, and affection can save their lives. 
        To a recovering rescued dog, you love will be the most important thing 
        in their life, and, in return, the dog shall love you unconditionally. 
        Please browse our website to get an idea of what these dogs go through.<br>
        <br/>
        See our abuse page in order to get an idea about specifically what trauma
        these dogs endure. The idea here isn’t to make you sad, but more to give 
        you the strength to adopt a rescue dog instead of a “clean” dog, and the 
        evidence to back up your decision and reaffirm that you’re doing the right
        thing.</p>

        We’ll bring you as close to the “Big Dogs Huge Paws” non-profit organization as 
        we can, so you can see all the amazing things that they do, from training their 
        staff to emotionally and physically healing the dogs to keeping their buildings 
        and stores stocked with high quality food and supplies 
        in order to give both themselves and nearby families the access to proper 
        equipment they need to give
        these dogs the life they have always deserved.<br/><br/>

        Check out our photos tab to see a plethora of photos. Here you can actually 
        experience the heartbreak of these dogs after their abuse, the embodiment of 
        perseverance and persistence of their recovery, and the unequalled joy of their
        new home/family. More than that, you can experience this across breeds of dogs,
        letting you connect with the breed that you love the most.<br><br>
        The form page is where you can let us know what we did well, and what we need to 
        improve upon in our website. It also lets us get a chance to know about your relationship with dogs.
        Whether you have one or not and even give some ideas you as an individual
        have on the rescuing of dogs. And even how to make a wonderful home for them.<br><br>
        The about us page is the page that will give the user a slight knowledge about who theses
    website developers are. Their talents, aspirations and some of their inspiration to accomplish this 
    goal.</p>
