        To be a part of the secret service requires at least a bachelors degree 
        to apply. Applicants need to pass an intensive background check in order
        to get government clearance. They must pass numerous academic tests in
        order to qualify. They need to be in top physical condition so that they
        can handle the rigors of the job they set to undertake – protecting the 
        leaders of one of the most influential countries (perhaps the most 
        influential, but that is beyond the scope of this website) in the past 
        century. To be willing to take a bullet for another person, given up who
        knows how many years of life in order to allow another to keep breathing
        for an undisclosed amount of time more. That kind of rigor is beyond what

        Big Dogs Huge Paws can provide, because these are not the leaders of 
        millions, but the abused of the people who could not handle the 
        responsibility of putting the life of another first. That’s where
    
    
        Big Dogs Huge Paws comes in.The heroes who call in Big Dogs Huge Paws 
        to help these innocent dogs are not highly trained covert operatives
        who work for years to hone their dog locating abilities. They are the 
        citizens who find a stray dog in the alley as they are driving to work
        and who get to work late because they stopped to make sure the dog was 
        given to the right people. They are the scholars who report suspected 
        puppy mills (where adorable puppies are breed for sale without regard 
        for the well being of the dogs who do the breeding nor the puppies who 
        do not get sold at the end of the day – profits are put first and the 
        dogs are exploited) because they would rather be wrong than let another
        being suffer because of their inactivity. Starvation is far too 
        commonplace for these dogs as well – no meals until they are skin 
        and bones. Dog fights are of course well known for their cruelty, 
        forcing the dogs to engage in physical combat they may well be too 
        weak to endure. Pushing the dogs to the end of their wits until they 
        fight, it being the only thing left after they have had their compassion
        and love for man stolen, waiting to be nursed back to health. Neglect, 
        where the dog is simply left alone with no support from a loving owner, 
        their own solitary confinement. Big Dogs Huge Paws does not have the 
        capital required to raid the streets of the world and make sure that all
        dogs are given access to the humane resources they provide, so they have
        to function off the good will of others and their proactiveness in 
        reporting dogs that need help. At that time, the shelter will take 
        in all the dogs they are able to support, and begin the healing process
        by beginning the rehabilitation process, reintroducing warmth, love, and
        kindness into their lives so that they may once again exist in peace and
        harmony with the world.
