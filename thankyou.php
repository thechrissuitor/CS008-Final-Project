        A huge thanks to "Big Dogs Huge Paws" in Houston Texas (their headquarters is 
        in Colorado, with many locations throughout the US) for letting us use 
        their photos, their testimonies and everything that they have provided us.
        We’d also like to thank this amazing organization for all the love and care
        that they provide these dogs in need. These dogs can come from the worst 
        of situations, and the work that “Big Dogs Huge Paws” does in order to not
        only train and educate their talented staff, but to provide access across
        the United States to high quality dog food, leashes, cleaning supplies, 
        grooming supplies, and more. The work that is done at “Big Dogs Huge Paws” 
        inspired us to make this website and will continue to inspire us as we go
        on in life. So once again, thank you for all the work you do, and we wish
        you the best, “Big Dogs Huge Paws.”

    Thank you, Professor Robert Erickson, for teaching us the art of website 
    design. Time has moved so quickly in this class (even when we were 
    working on forms for a month) but we still managed to learn a lot 
    about HTML, PHP and CSS. Hopefully at least some of us will see you 
    soon in another one of your website design classes in the not so 
    distant future!

    Thank you, Professor Joan Rosebush, for helping us come up with a name for our 
    website. This was a big undertaking for us, and every little bit helps, even 
    the seemingly innocuous but extremely important task of choosing a name for 
    our website. We’re all excited to see you next semester in Calculus II, assuming
    we can get into your class!

    Thank you, TAs, for putting in the hours, giving us advice, answering 

    our questions, and all with a smile and a great attitude. We also want to
    thank you for being able to put up with Bob!

    We also want to thank the dogs for being so amazing by adapting to their 
    situation and taking in the love that “Big Dogs Huge Paws” has been giving
    them. The events you’ve endured are harrowing, and to think that you all 
    came out on top of it is inspiring to us all.<br><br>

    Christopher T. Suitor: “A huge thank you goes to Ms. Jeanne. My love for 
    dogs bloomed while spending time volunteering with you.  Also, a gigantic
    thank you goes to Eve. I love you, Eve! Thank you for being so adorable,
    sweet, and everything good!”<br><br>

    Kieran M. Edraney: “Thanks to my mom and sister! You guys are both supper
    supportive of me and have helped me a ton both in college and getting here.

    Mikie, you’re pretty cool too and I’m excited to get to know you. See you soon!”

    Nana Nimako: "To all friends and families out there who support me to go higher
    and support my dreams. I would like to take this great platform to thank you.
    I would like to make it clear that also; hold on, for the great times awaits.
