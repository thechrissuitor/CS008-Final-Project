    <p>
        Christopher Thomas Suitor is the project manager for this website. He is 
        currently a first-year student at the University of Vermont majoring in 
        Computer Science and Information Systems. Coming from Houston, Texas, 
        Christopher is exciting to build an education focusing on computer science
        so that he may enter the video game industry. Christopherâ€™s love for dogs 
        comes from his volunteer service in high school when he worked with Big Dogs 
        Huge Dogs rescue. Caring for Mastiffs and Great Danes, Christopher was placed
        in charge of rehabilitating the dogs, so they would be comfortable entered a 
        family environment. At the end of his service at Big Dogs Huge Paws, 
        Christopher and his family adopted Eve, and they now live happily together.<br><br>
